Inheritance:

1. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object Oriented Programming. 
2. It is the process of inheriting features (variables and methods)
   from one class to another class.
3. The class which is being inherited is called Base class or Parent class and 
   the class which inherits the Base class is called Derived class or Child 
   class.
4. Inheritance is used to promote Code reusability and readability. 
5. Inheritance is used to achieve method overriding and polymorphism. 
6. Types of Inheritance:
   a. Single Inheritance
      A sub class is derived from only one super class. 

   b. Multilevel Inheritance
      A sub class is derived from an already derived class from another class.

   c. Hierarchical Inheritance
      One class serves as a super class for more than one child class.

   d. Multiple Inheritance
      A class is derived from more than one class. (Only achieved through
      interface) It is not supported with java classes.

   e. Hybrid Inheritance
      Combination of two or more of the above types.
