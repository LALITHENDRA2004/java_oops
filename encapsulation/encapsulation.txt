Encapsulation:

1. The process of restring direct access to the sensitive data from the 
   users is called Encapsulation. 
2. It binds the attributes(properties) and methods(behaviours) into a 
   single object.
3. It is used for better code management. Which means we can modify the 
   code without affecting the other parts of the code. (Validation)
   Ex: balance += amount -> if(amount > 0) balance += amount;
4. The process of Encapsulation is that 
   - The variables in the class are declared private to prevent direct 
     access. 
   - public setter methods are used to set the values 
   - public getter methods are used to access the values
