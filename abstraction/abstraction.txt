Abstraction:

1. The process of hiding the implementation details by showing only the 
   necessary details is called Abstraction.
2. It allows to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
3. Abstraction can be implemented in two ways:
   a. Abstract classes (Partial abstraction)
      - abstract keyword is used to define an abstract class.
      - an abstract class can contain abstract methods (declared using 
        abstract keyword) and also concrete methods (normal methods)
      - the subclass should implement all the abstract methods of the super 
        class unless the subclass is also declared as abstract 
      - we can not create an object for an abstract classes 
      - the methods of the abstract class should be accessed via its sub-class  

   b. Interfaces (100% abstraction) 
      - an interface contains only method declarations 
      - the class which implements the interface should define the methods
      - the methods in an interface are public abstract by default 
      - there is no need to declare them public abstract 
      - an interface can extend another interface 
4. We indicate a method is an overridden method using the annotation 
   @override. 
5. It makes the code readable.
6. And also it makes sure that the method is actually overridden one or not.
