OOP - Object Oriented Programming 

1. Object Oriented Programming is about creating objects that contain both
   data and methods.
2. It promotes reusability and readablility.
3. It makes the program in a structured manner.
4. Classes and Objects are main aspects in OOP.
5. A Class is a user defined data type which specifies the data(fields) and
   behaviour(methods) the objects of that class will have.
6. It is a blue print or template for creating objects.
7. A class do not occupy memory for instance variables until an object is 
   created.
8. An object is an instance of class.
9. A class can have two types of variables:
   a. Instance variables 
      To access these variables, we need to create an object.
   b. Static variables 
      We do not need to create the object to access these variables. These 
      variables are not specific to an object. They are said to be Class 
      variables.
10. class key word is used to create a class. 
    Ex: 
    class Student {
        String name = "Lalithendra";
    } 
11. An object is created using class name 
    Ex: 
    Student student = new Student();
    Here,
    -> student is the referece variable which stores the reference of the 
       object stored in the heap memory 
    -> Student denotes the type of the reference variable student 
    -> new is a key word used to create the object. It allocates memory on 
       the heap and returns the reference of the object.
    -> Sudent() refers to the constructor of the Student class 
    -> new Student() combinely creates the object which is stored in heap 
       memory 
    -> student is stored in stack memory
