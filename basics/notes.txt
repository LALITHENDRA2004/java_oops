Some important points:

1. If the class is public, the file name must match the class name. Because,
    a) When we run 'javac FileName.java', the compiler looks for a public 
       class named FileName. The compiler uses file names to find the 
       public classes. If both the names don't match it is not possible 
       to locate or load the class. 
    b) We do not need to open the file to know whether the class is present 
       inside the file or not. Just by seeing the file name we came to know
       about it.
    c) Public classes are meant to be accessed from anywhere. Hence it needs 
       a clear way to locate them.
2. If the class is package-private, there is no need to match the file name 
   and class name. The access is within the same package, so no issue arises.
3. Each public class should be put inside a file with same name as that of 
   the class to maintain clear file-to-class mapping. Which means no two 
   public classes should be under same file.
