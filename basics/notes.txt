Some important points:

1. If the class is public, the file name must match the class name. Because,
    a) When we run 'javac FileName.java', the compiler looks for a public 
       class named FileName. The compiler uses file names to find the public
       classes. If the file name doesn't match the public class name, the
       compiler will throw a compile-time error, because it cannot find the 
       entry point for the program.  
    b) We do not need to open the file to know the name of the class.
       Just by seeing the file name we came to know it.
    c) Public classes are meant to be accessed from anywhere. Hence it needs 
       a clear way to locate them.
2. If the class is package-private, there is no need to match the file name 
   and class name. Because the compiler wont refer the class via file name 
   if it is not public. It refers via binary name (package + class).
3. Each public class should be put inside a file with same name as that of 
   the class to maintain clear file-to-class mapping. Which means no two 
   public classes should be under same file.
